# Eat That Burger! 
* A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
* A restuarant app that lets the user input the type or name of the burger you'd like to eat. 
* Whenever the user submit's a burger's name, Eat That Burger will display the new burger on the page.
* Then it's time to eat!

# How to Use 
Under "Available Burgers" are the burgers that have not been eaten. Click on "devour dis burger" to move the burger to where eaten burgers live, under "Devoured Burgers". 
If you'd like a new Burger made, type the name next to "Burger Name" and click "Make My Burger, Please!" Your new burger will then appear under "Available Burgers".
