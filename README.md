# Eat That Burger! 
* A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
* A restuarant app that lets the user input the type or name of the burger you'd like to eat. 
* Whenever the user submit's a burger's name, Eat That Burger will display the new burger on the page.
* Then it's time to eat!
